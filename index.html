    <hr class="section-hr">
    <p>If there is a major upper hand that UAE free zones have over mainland, it’s the fact that no local sponsor is required to start a business. That means there is no splitting of 51% shares, hence 100% foreign ownership is allowed. The government of UAE has set up multiple free zones across the country so businesses can take advantage of tax-free statuses and low trade barriers where you can manufacture, import, export, and produce goods without paying any customs duty.</p>
    <p>Free zones are usually located next to airports, sea ports, and national borders to maximize ease of trading. Check out this list of free zones to see which one best suits your business.</p>

    <h2 class="highlight" style="text-align: center;">UAE Mainland</h2>
    <hr class="section-hr">
    <p>UAE is one of the best countries in the Gulf to start up a mainland company setup due to its strategic location, taking less than 7 hours flying time to most countries, a vibrant economic policy, and multicultural lifestyle. The country also has zero corporate tax, encourages innovative business approaches, and offers easy licensing processes. Natural resources, such as oil and the tourism sectors, have made the country a dynamic business hub.</p>
    <p>If you are planning for a business setup in the UAE mainland, here is some basic information to help you get started.</p>

    <!-- UAE Mainland LLC Information -->
    <h4 class="mt-5">UAE Mainland Limited Liability Company (LLC)</h4>
    <p>A mainland Limited Liability Company (LLC) is registered with the government in one of the UAE Department of Economic Development (UAE DED). As per the government rules, you must register a business with the UAE DED to conduct business in the UAE mainland. Once registered, you will be provided with a business license to start operations in the UAE.</p>
    <p>Mainland companies are not limited to free zones and can operate in various sectors, including industry, tourism, commercial, professional, or trading sectors. UAE mainland companies also enjoy access to better deals on office spaces and rents.</p>
    <p>A mainland company requires sponsorship by a UAE national as a Local Partner or a National Service Agent. Foreign investors can start their business with 51% ownership for a UAE national and the remaining 49% for other shareholders. For complete control, investors can opt for a Sole Establishment, allowing 100% ownership.</p>

    <!-- Difference Between Mainland and Free Zone -->
    <h5 class="mt-4">Difference between Mainland and Free Zone</h5>
    <p>An investor in a mainland company in the UAE is permitted to trade within the UAE market and internationally without restrictions. A free zone company, however, operates within a designated special jurisdiction under a specific emirate and is limited to conducting business within that free zone. Investors aiming for tax optimization might consider setting up a business in a free zone, as free zone authorities offer various benefits and incentives.</p>

    <!-- Benefits of Business Setup in UAE Mainland -->
    <h5 class="mt-4">Benefits of Owning a Business Setup in UAE Mainland</h5>

    <h2 class="highlight" style="text-align: center;">UAE Offshore</h2>
    <hr class="section-hr">
    <p>Offshores are one of the best alternatives for businesses in different countries that want to have a headquarters in another country. It’s a great way to get rid of unnecessary taxes (given that your headquarters are in a tax-free country like the UAE), access your funds and move them around easily in a legal manner, and overall have fewer hassles in maintaining your business.</p>
    <p>Before we get into the how’s and what’s, let’s figure out what an offshore company is. An offshore company is a business or organization that is operated outside of its original country. It can be owned by an individual or have multiple investors, shareholders, or partners. The business activities of an offshore company are performed outside of its jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>UAE offers a hassle-free, affordable, and tax-free offshore company formation. It has also proved to be a trustworthy country for business owners. With its various benefits, UAE offshore has become a reliable, popular, and dynamic platform for companies and investors to set up their businesses. UAE offshore companies are issued a certificate of incorporation, not licenses, hence company formations in any UAE offshore jurisdictions have become an easy process.</p>
    <p>The two main and popular jurisdictions in the UAE are Ras Al Khaimah and Jebel Ali Free Zones. They are both tax-free and allow 100% foreign ownership. Bear in mind that offshore companies are not free zones.</p>
    <p>Offshore companies can open a UAE bank account with multi-currencies to carry out their business internationally with the head of an office being in the UAE. This gives the business owners full control of their funds.</p>
    <p>Offshore jurisdictions have their own set of rules and so do the company registrations and handling. This is where we come in. UAE Company Registration saves your time by handling all your paperwork, setting up the business for you, and making sure that you have no legal problems. All you have to do is sit back and relax as we handle your company set-up in the safest and easiest way.</p>

        <h4>Why Asset Protection is Important</h4>
        <hr class="choose-hr">
        <p>Since UAE has become a competitive global hub for businesses and entrepreneurs, the issue of asset protection grew in its importance. The assets that you wish to protect could include your company’s funds, real estate etc. Registering the assets in the company can become the best solution for asset protection.</p>
        

        <p>Asset Protection protects the assets belonging to a certain company or individual from third party claims who try to seize your assets. They provide financial stability and reduce the risk of losing your earned property which could be money, real estate, vehicles etc.</p>
        
        <h4>Asset Protection Strategies</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>LLC Company Formations or Limited Partnerships</b> – LLC formation companies reap more benefits from securing the company’s assets than anything else because the separation of liabilities becomes a major playing point in asset protection. Directors and shareholders get more advantages than sole proprietors.</li>
            <li><b>Asset protection trust</b> – This type of asset protection allows businesses to remove the legally binding ownership of a particular person to an asset. For example, a person (a shareholder or a director) does not own some portion of the property contributed to the business, and if there is no evidence of the ownership, the property cannot be taken away. This asset protection is more beneficial than a will allowing business owners to keep control of their assets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The best way to seek asset protection for businesses and companies in the UAE is to seek expert advice on the subject matter. UAE Company Registration has helped many business owners and investors in asset protection. Depending on your needs and circumstances, we can ensure that your assets are successfully protected.</p>
